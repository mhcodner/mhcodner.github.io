I am now <strong>the most senior non-manager engineer</strong> in my team and\n            this brings the responsibility of being a leader.\n            <br />\n            Being a leader to my team is important as they look up to me in times of uncertainty when they are\n            unsure of how best to proceed with an issue. This can be both technical assistance and assistance with\n            their soft skills.

If you can't follow the process yourself then you can't expect your team\n            to also follow the process.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </section>\n\n      <section id=\"teamwork\" className=\"six\">\n        <div className=\"container\">\n          <header>\n            <h2>Teamwork</h2>\n          </header>\n\n          <p>\n            Teamwork is extremely important in any engineering role. In my team it is especially important\n            as we operate 24/7. This means that we operate on a shift basis and if you're not on time for\n            your shift then you are letting the team down.\n            <br />\n            I have been proficient at working in a team environment and excel at understanding the strengths\n            of my team members so that I can have them work on the most appropriate tasks and tickets for\n            their strengths and weaknesses.\n            <br />\n            Evidence of my teamwork can be seen particularly when we deal with major incidents at work.
