          <p>
            As an engineering professional I consistently aim to further develop myself both
            professionally and personally. In my spare time I enjoy playing with video games,
            tinkering with electronics, or taking photos.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the past few years I have grown to enjoy the infrastructure side of the
            cloud. Day-to-day you'll find me working on the physical hardware of servers, switches,
            routers, and firewalls, all the way up to dealing with the applications running on
            a virtual machine. Having control over the whole tech-stack is my passion.

            At Macquarie Cloud Services I have spent my first 2 years as a tier 1 HMC Engineer.
            I have now spent the last year and a half as a Tier 2 HMC Engineer.
            <br />
            As a HMC Engineer, Iâ€™m part of a team of cloud specialists delivering hybrid cloud
            solutions for business customers.

            I'm currently studying a <strong>Bachelor of ICT Engineering</strong> with a Submajor in Software,
            and a Diploma in Professional Engineering Practice at <strong>The University of Technology, Sydney (UTS)</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my studies some of my favourite subjects have been the more practical subjects
            such as:
            <ul>
              <li>Introductory Digital Systems</li>
              <li>Software Engineering Practice</li>
              <li>Internet Of Things</li>

          <p>
            Having spent the past year and a half as a tier 2 engineer I have been providing mentorship to
            the junior engineers. I am now the most senior non-manager engineer in my team and this brings
            the responsibility of being a leader.
